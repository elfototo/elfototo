### My Latest Project: [Davai S Nami](https://github.com/elfototo/davai-s-nami)

This is my latest major project built with **Next.js**. It’s a website for searching events — simple to use and with an attractive interface.

- **GSAP** — for adding smooth animations and enhancing user experience.
- **Lodash** — for convenient utilities to work with data.
